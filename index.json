    "summary": "Urgent action is needed to address climate change, land degradation, and biodiversity loss. The Regreening Africa project (2017–2023), recently recognized as a UN World Restoration Flagship, aimed to reverse land degradation over large areas of land for the triple benefit of people, biodiversity, and climate in eight African countries. Based on projections and early lessons learned, the project sought to identify sustainable scaling models to achieve its ambitious targets. The so-called “Asset-Based Community-driven Development (ABCD) in Regreening” project aimed to demonstrate the positive contribution of deliberate community engagement and co-design. The project introduced ABCD sessions to 30 purposively selected community groups in the Regreening intensification sites in western Kenya. ABCD combines a unique set of framings, methods, and processes that focus on people’s assets and agency, and emphasizes the importance of their attitudes toward self and others for sustainable behavior change. To evidence that ABCD intrinsically contributes to sustainable adoption and scaling of Regreening practices, the project developed the F-ACT+ tool to assess the alignment between ABCD and agroecological practices, and collected baseline and endline data from 300 project and 300 non-project participants. Results showed accelerated agroecological integration among ABCD project participants. ABCD participants showed significant improvements in nine agroecological principles and eight system components, particularly in the economic diversification, social values and diets, and knowledge cocreation principles, as well as in the pest and disease, household, and value chain system components. Summary ATT between ABCD and non-ABCD respondents was positive and significant in 10 principles and eight system components. The results support the synergistic contribution of ABCD to projects targeting sustainable behavior change at the individual and collective levels. Due to its focus on outcomes, this study provided limited insight into the specific mechanisms of ABCD, which are the subject of a separate publication on parallel theory-based contribution analysis work.",

    "summary": "The catalytic effect of climate change on the emergence and prevalence of invasive alien pests along with weak pesticide regulatory frameworks in developing countries calls for a transition towards sustainable pest management. Agro-ecological pest management (APM) offers a nature-based, cost-effective alternative for addressing systemic pest challenges, such as mango fruit fly invasion. We applied a two-part fractional regression to sequentially model APM adoption and intensity decisions among 423 smallholder mango orchard managers from Makueni County, Kenya. Despite APM’s potential, we observed moderate adoption rates (56.7%), with the average adopter implementing only 25% of the APM practices concurrently. Farmers’ socio-psychological attributes significantly influenced both adoption and intensity decisions. While perceptions of technology attributes and institutional and social factors primarily influenced both the adoption and intensity decisions, information constraints, resource endowment, gender and inter-generational factors significantly influenced only the intensity decision. To support the transition from synthetic insecticides to APM measures, policymakers should create more opportunities for awareness creation, training and knowledge co-creation and co-production, particularly through social networks and gender-disaggregated participatory group approaches.",

    "summary": "How can communities, scientists, development practitioners and policymakers better understand the impact of their interventions? On September 24, 2024, the Qualitative Studies Group explored this crucial question in a session led by Lisa Elena Fuchs and Sulman Olieko Owili, moderated by Fanny Howland. Lisa is a social and agroecological systems scientist, and expert in sustainable landscape transitions at the Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT. Sulman is an agricultural economist consulting for IITA, CIFOR-ICRAF, and the Alliance. The session focused on how to leverage data from realist contribution analysis—a method that reveals not just the results of an intervention, but also how it works, which aspects are effective, to what extent, for whom and in what contexts. This approach sheds light on how individual actors within complex systems drive change, offering valuable insights for those working in agroecology, community development, and related fields.",

    "summary": "Since its detection in 2003 in Kenya, the invasive fruit fly Bactrocera dorsalis has become a significant threat to mango production and marketing. To combat its impact, many mango producers in Kenya and other Sub-Saharan African countries have relied on synthetic insecticides. However, these insecticides are costly for smallholder farmers and pose environmental impacts and health risks to orchard managers, workers, and consumers. This has prompted the need for more sustainable pest management practices, aligning with global efforts like the United Nations’ ”Decade on Ecosystem Restoration” (2021–2030), which emphasises ecological balance and sustainable agricultural practices. This study investigates the efficiency effects of adopting and intensifying 18 [1] agro-ecological pest management (APM) practices among smallholder mango farmers in Kenya.",
